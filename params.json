This initial alignment is then refined using pairwise point-to-plane ICP.\r\n\r\nThe result of this step is a tree of relative pose constraints. In a subsequent global optimization step, we build up a graph of absolute poses, our vertices, from the tree of initial relative pose estimates by adding further edges. We add edges for the k-nearest-neighbors of a vertex, taking the translational difference of the corresponding poses as a distance measure. Constraints between two vertices are added for each closest point correspondence in their respective point clouds. The global point-toplane energy is then minimized iteratively using the nonlinear least-squares method called Multiview Levenberg-Marquardt ICP.\r\n\r\nThis refined registration of all the scans used may now be integrated and their corresponding point clouds fused and then meshed to obtain the final reconstructed 3D object mesh.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n* Haarbach, Adrian [3D Object Reconstruction using Point Pair Features](http://adrian-haarbach.de/bscthesis_adrian.pdf).
